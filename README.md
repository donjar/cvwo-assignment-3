# Mid-assignment

I haven't started to work on this yet, but I did:
- install Linux as dual-boot with Windows
- install Ruby, Rails and a lot of stuff
- learned unix terminal commands and how to use vim
- learned basic Ruby
- deployed a test app into Heroku

Looking forward I think this is the right way to go :)
